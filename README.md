# 3d-boat-physics
Code for my 3d game boat physics post which deals most importantly with [buoyancy](https://gameidea.org/2023/12/08/3d-boat-physics/). Here 4 main forces are discussed: thrust, drag, buoyancy & gravity. Right now, it is simple, but in future, I'll extend it & add volume calculation for complex 3D geometry. Right now, the first version of post is published.
